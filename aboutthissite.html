      This website is our final requirements for our subject (Integrated Programming and Technologies). But honestly,
      We didn't do this website to only pass this subject or just for academic requirements only, but also to motivate and inspire other people especially to those who are encountering or suffering depression, anxiety and other mental issue that affects the persons life. Because nowadays mental problem are very rampant especially to those students who are in online class. That's why we decided to make this kind of website, so that somehow we can help a little bit with the students like us and other people.

      Almost all material being used here such as picture, videos and more are from the different platforms but we make sure that all of this materials are under the creative common, if there is any material that we have obtained that is not under the creative common, it is all a mistake or accidental. </p>
