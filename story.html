     <p class="text">
      There was a man who had four sons. He wanted his sons to learn to not judge things too quickly. So he sent them each on a quest, in turn, to go and look at a pear tree that was a great distance away.
      <br>
    The first son went in the winter, the second in the spring, the third in summer, and the youngest son in the fall.
    <br>
    When they had all gone and come back, he called them together to describe what they had seen.
    <br>
   The first son said that the tree was ugly, bent, and twisted.
    <br>
    The second son said no - it was covered with green buds and full of promise.
    <br>
    The third son disagreed, he said it was laden with blossoms that smelled so sweet and looked so beautiful, it was the most graceful thing he had ever seen.
    <br>
    The last son disagreed with all of them; he said it was ripe and drooping with fruit, full of life and fulfillment.
    <br>
    The man then explained to his sons that they were all right, because they had each seen but one season in the tree's life.
    <br>
    Inspirational Stories
    <br>
    He told them that you cannot judge a tree, or a person, by only one season, and that the essence of who they are and the pleasure, joy, and love that come from that life - can only be measured at the end, when all the seasons are up.
    <br>
    If you give up when it's winter, you will miss the promise of your spring, the beauty of your summer, fulfilment of your fall.
    <br>
    Don't judge a life by one difficult season. Don't let the pain of one season destroy the joy of all the rest.

<h3 class="title">"A MAN WHO LOST IN DESERT"</h3>
<details>
 <summary class="text">Tap here to see the story!</summary>
<p class="text">
Once a man got lost in a desert. The water in his flask had run out two days ago, and he was on his last legs. He knew that if he didn't get some water soon, he would surely die. The man saw a small hut ahead of him. He thought it would be a mirage or maybe a hallucination, but having no other option, he moved toward it. As he got closer, he realized it was quite real. So he dragged his tired body to the door with the last of his strength.
<br>
The hut was not occupied and seemed like it had been abandoned for quite some time. The man entered into it, hoping against hope that he might find water inside.
<br>
His heart skipped a beat when he saw what was in the hut- a water hand pump...... It had a pipe going down through the floor, perhaps tapping a
<br>
source of water deep under-ground.
He began working the hand pump, but no water
came out. He kept at it and still nothing
happened. Finally he gave up from exhaustion
and frustration. He threw up his hands in
despair. It looked as if he was going to die after
all.
<br>
Then the man noticed a bottle in one corner of the hut. It was filled with water and corked up to prevent evaporation.
<brbr>
He uncorked the bottle and was about to gulp down the sweet life-giving water, when he noticed a piece of paper attached to it. Handwriting on the paper read: "Use this water to start the pump. Don't forget to fill the bottle when you're done."
<br>
He had a dilemma. He could follow the instruction and pour the water into the pump, or
he could ignore it and just drink the water.
What to do? If he let the water go into the pump,
what assurance did he have that it would work?
What if the pump malfunctioned? What if the
pipe had a leak? What if the underground
reservoir had long dried up?
But then... maybe the instruction was correct. Should he risk it? If it turned out to be false, he would be throwing away the last water he would ever see.
Hands trembling, he poured the water into the pump. Then he closed his eyes, said a prayer, and started working the pump..
He heard a gurgling sound, and then water came gushing out, more than he could possibly use. He luxuriated in the cool and refreshing stream. He was going to live!
After drinking his fill and feeling much better, he looked around the hut. He found a pencil and a map of the region. The map showed that he was still far away from civilization, but at least now he knew where he was and which direction to go.
<br>
He filled his flask for the journey ahead. He also
filled the bottle and put the cork back in. Before
leaving the hut, he added his own writing below
the instruction: "Believe me, it works!" Inspirational Stories
This story is all about life. It teaches us that We must GIVE before We can RECEIVE Abundantly.
<br>
More importantly, it also teaches that FAITH plays an important role in GIVING. The man did not know if his action would be rewarded, but he proceeded regardless.
<br>
Without knowing what to expect, he made a
Leap of Faith.
Water in this story represents the Good things in
Life.

Give life some "Water" to Work with, and it will
RETURN far more than you put in .........!!

<h3 class="title">"THE EMPTY BOAT"</h3>
<details>
 <summary class="text">Tap here to see the story!</summary>
<p class="text">
A monk decides to meditate alone, away from his monastery. He takes his boat out to the middle of the lake, moors it there, closes his eyes and begins his meditation.

After a few hours of undisturbed silence, he

suddenly feels the bump of another boat colliding with his own. With his eyes still closed, he senses his anger rising, and by the time he opens his eyes, he is ready to scream at the boatman who dared disturb his meditation.

But when he opens his eyes, he sees it's an empty boat that had probably got untethered and floated to the middle of the lake. At that moment, the monk achieves self realization, and understands that the anger is within him; it merely needs the bump of an external object to provoke it out of him.

From then on, whenever he comes across someone who irritates him or provokes him to anger, he reminds himself, "The other person is merely an empty boat. The anger is within me."

Some useful timeless tips

1. Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age, weight and height. Let the doctors worry about them. That is why you pay 'them'

2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull

you down.

3. Keep learning. Learn more about the

computer, crafts, gardening, whatever.. Never let

the brain idle. 'An idle mind is the devil's

workshop.' And the devil's name is Alzheimer's.

4. Enjoy the simple things.

5.. Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath.

6. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person, who is with us our entire life, is ourselves. Be ALIVE while you are alive.

7. Surround yourself with what you love,

whether it's family, pets, keepsakes, music,

plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your

refuge.

8. Cherish your health: If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you

can improve, get help.

9. Don't take guilt trips. Take a trip to the mall, even to the next county; to a foreign country but NOT to where the guilt is.

10. Tell the people you love that you love them,

at every opportunity. AND ALWAYS REMEMBER :Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.

We all need to live life to its fullest each day, Worry about nothing, pray about everything!!!

<h3 class="title">"THE STORY ABOUT THE MAN AND THE BOAT "</h3>
<details>
 <summary class="text">Tap here to see the story!</summary>
<p class="text">
One day a man was asked to paint a boat by an owner of boat. He brought with him paint and brushes and began to paint the boat a bright red, as the owner asked him*.

While painting, he realized there was a hole in the hull and decided to repair it.

When finished painting, he received his money and left.*

The next day, the owner of the boat came to the painter and presented him with a nice check, much higher than the payment for painting.

The painter was surprised:

- You've already paid me for painting the boat! - he said. - But this is not for the paint job.

It's for having repaired the hole in the boat. -*Ah! But it was such a small service... certainly it's not worth paying me such a high

amount for something so insignificant!* My dear friend, you do not understand. Let me

tell you what happened.

When I asked you to paint the boat, I forgot to

mention about the hole.*

When the boat dried, my kids took the boat and went on a fishing trip.

They did not know that there was a hole.

I was not at home at that time.

When I returned and noticed they had taken the boat, I was desperate because I remembered that the boat had a hole.

Imagine my relief and joy when I saw them returning from fishing.

Then, I examined the boat and found that you had repaired the hole! You see, now, what you did?* You saved the life of my children! I do not have enough money to pay your "small" good deed.

#Moral of the story

So, no matter who, when or how. Just continue to help, sustain, wipe tears, listen attentively and carefully repair all the "leaks" you find, because you never know when one is in need of us or when God holds a pleasant surprise for us to be helpful and important to someone.
