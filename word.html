            <h3 class="title">"Always embrace where you are"</h3>
            <p class="text">On days when you were not able to catch the train on time, or when you found yourself as the last person standing in a queue, may you never forget that there are these tiny and ordinary things that are beautiful to watch too as they slowly unfold while you are taking pauses.
<br>
            Yes, everyone may be ahead of you and starting to unlock and live their dreams. Yes, you may have seen them starting to win, but don’t you see that you are winning too? It doesn’t matter how grand or small it is, what matters is you celebrate for it. Do not be disheartened to see yourself not getting in places yet.
<br>
            If you feel like you are not worthy of anything just because you have not proven anything to yourself yet or you have nothing to offer yet, may you be reminded that you are not less worthy of the good things regardless of your progress and disposition.
            <br>
            
            In the end of the day, you will understand why you had to be where you are in the moment.

            <p class="text">Do the things that you believe is right.
            Even if the whole world tells you that you're doing it wrong.
            <br>
            Do not let people judge you on what and who you are.
            Do not let their thoughts and beliefs define you.
            Even in the way on how you do your own things.
            <br>
            Because you don't need to prove yourself to everyone.
            You just need to love and know yourself even more.
            <br>
            For you're the only one who knows yourself better.
            And you're the only one who knows what's the best for yourself rather than anyone else.

            <p class="text">You don't have to be positive. You don't have to feel guilty about fear or sadness or anger. You don't stop the rain by telling it to stop. Sometimes you just have to let it pour, let it soak you to your skin. It never rains for ever. And know that, however wet you get, you are not the rain. You are not the bad feelings in your head. You are the person experiencing the storm. The storm may knock you off your feet.
             But you will stand again. 
             Hold on.”

            <p class="text">Everything is going to heal in the end - open wounds, scars, broken hearts and you. You are going to heal, my love. It may seem as if you are going to feel this pain forever but I promise you that this feeling is going to fade. One day you will not feel the weight that heavily anymore; one day you will not be that scared anymore; one day you will not only see the sunshine but feel its warmth on your skin and be aware of the fact that you are still alive despite it all. You are going to heal, darling. I promise.”

            <p class="text">There’s so much more to life than finding someone who will want you, or being sad over someone who doesn’t. There’s a lot of wonderful time to be spent discovering yourself without hoping someone will fall in love with you along the way, and it doesn't need to be painful or empty. You need to fill yourself up with love. Not anyone else. Become a whole being on your own. Go on adventures, fall asleep in the woods with friends, wander around the city at night, sit in a coffee shop on your own, write on bathroom stalls, leave notes in library books, dress up for yourself, give to others, smile a lot. Do all things with love, but don't romanticize life like you can’t survive without it. Live for yourself and be happy on your own. It isn’t any less beautiful, I promise."

            <p class="text">"Sometimes we just feel bad, no matter how well our day went. Sometimes we still feel lost, sad and even jealous and we feel all of this at once, for no apparent reason. But please don't be too hard on yourself - while it is quite easy to control your thoughts, controlling your emotions is a particularly hard thing to do. Sometimes we feel that way and that's okay. Don't beat yourself up or convince yourself that you are failing again because you are absolutely not. You are doing incredibly fine and no bad day, no string of bad phases is ever going to erase your progress. Just allow yourself to feel and be if necessary and take good care."

            <p class="text">Sometimes, unnoticed, but as we grow older, our favorites are starting to change, our interest on things and people no longer hold a place in our hearts, and our perspectives on things are directing us into higher yet deeper places. It is our intrinsic urge to venture new things, to go for a change, to become better and set our eyes upon a different horizon. So, it is okay to leave some things in the previous page and no longer taking them in the succeeding pages. We don't have to blame ourselves if we prefer to keep what matters most to us. We don't have to feel guilty of leaving an a jar door for a few and close it to people who are unnecessary on our becoming. We are doing fine, we all go through transitions—they are all part of our growth.

            <h3 class="title">"Don't Regret"</h3>
            <p class="text">And there will be times when you will know that no matter how hard you try, you have a higher possibility of failing. You will find yourself unprepared for the worst and all your hopes and dreams will shatter in front of your eyes. You will immediately want to give up, to put yourself out of your misery but those are the moments that will determine who you become. It's okay to take a step back when you know you are not ready but I hope you don't run away just because you are afraid. I hope you don't give it up just because you have been living in fear for so long that you don't know how to free yourself. I hope that in those golden moments, you choose to be brave because they will remind you for the rest of your life that even at the point of absolute chaos, you had the determination to go on. If there is anything you can carry in this world, let it be hope. Even if you cannot completely decide who you want to be, please dream and hope for something and then, try to live a little in it. Not just daydream about it, but live in it. If tomorrow makes you feel like there's no way to make it through, you still have to give your best. It may look futile but giving 15% is still better than giving 0%. When you are done, you won't find yourself questioning 'what if'. You will know that your body and your mind gave the best that you are capable of now. Failures are a part of life and they only bring you closer to the person you want to be. Even if it feels like there are no real changes, you have grown in tiny, unrecognisable ways. You are closer to your dreams than you were a year ago. Do not regret what you didn't and couldn't do. Instead, be proud of your small steps and keep trying. There will be a day when you will make it through.

     It's inevitable to get hurt and it's understandable to move on at a slow pace.
